// Hi, I'm @Thistlefern!

// My real name is Josie DeRosier, though.

// I love games, and am learning to be a video game programmer.

// I'd like to make games a that tell a good story.

// My favorite genre of games is survival crafting, but my favorite game story-wise is Portal 2.

// I'm just here to store my school code, currentl, but maybe someday I'll be open to collaborating on bigger projects!
